## WHY another server
In my usecase python simple http server was not able to serve a simple flutter static app. However, a simple go server works.

## Deployment
make install

## Development
Currently, the directory that is served is the current directory. It is served on 0.0.0.0:9000. This configuration is currently hardcoded.

The functionality may vary and made more modular when deemed appropriate.
